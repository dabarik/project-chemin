The project is about to enter 2 cities, for example A and B and it returns the way you can go. (with a map and all the details about the ride)

There are 3 files .csv with BUS, CAR and TRAIN which it gives you all the data about the path between 2 cities always. 
There are sereval details as the duration, the distance, the means of the transport and so on. 

I use JavaFX for the interface.
